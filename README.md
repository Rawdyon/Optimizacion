# Simplex Method Interface

## Overview
This repository contains an interface for solving linear optimization problems using the Simplex Method. The interface takes a linear optimization problem as input, calls an external executable file that solves the problem, and displays the solutions obtained.

## Introduction
The Simplex Method is a widely used algorithm for solving linear programming problems. This interface provides an easy-to-use tool for solving such problems without the need for understanding the intricacies of the underlying algorithm.

## Usage
To use the interface, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Rawdyon/Optimization-simplex-method-interface.git
3. Install any necessary dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. Place your linear optimization problem in a format compatible with the external executable file. This could be a text file or any other format accepted by the executable.

5. Run the script "SimplexMethod.py",

First the interface will request the number of your problem variables and restrictions, and the type of optimization problem (could be for maximization or minimization) as input:

then will let you set the coeficients and restrictions of your variables, this is an example for a Maximization problem with 3 variables 4 restrictions.

6. The interface will call the external executable, solve the problem, and display the solutions obtained.
